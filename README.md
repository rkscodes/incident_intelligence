# Incidence Intelligence ðŸ”Ž

A data pipeline that utilizes the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) process to fetch, load, and transform San Francisco Police Department incident data, with the aim of generating insights.

## Description
As new incidents occur on a daily basis, I am attempting to gather insights that will enable us to take better measures. Specifically, I am seeking answers to the following questions:

1.What is the frequency of incidents over time?

2.Which incidents happen most frequently?

3.Which areas are hotspots of crime in San Francisco?

4.On which day and month do most incidents happen?

5.What are the trends of incidents in districts over the years?

6.How many active and closed cases are there?


## Tech Stack

**Infrastructure**: Terraform

**Cloud:** Google Cloud

**Data lake:** Google Cloud Storage

**Data warehouse:** BigQuery

**Orchestration:** Prefect

**Data transformation:** DBT

**Data visualization:** Google Looker Studio

## Installation

### Install Project
1. Make sure you have `docker`, `make` and `git` installed in your pc.
2. Git clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rkscodes/incident_intelligence.git
   cd incident_intelligence
   ```
3. Make a virtual env with python=3.9 and install prefect: 
    ```bash
    conda create -n incidence python=3.9 prefect
    ```
4. Activate your env: 
      ``` bash
      conda activate incidence
      ```
5. Refer  [Setup Terraform](#setup-terraform) to setup cloud infra.
6. Make changes in `config.json` file with same details as in `variables.tf`.
7. Run prefect server: 
   ``` bash
   prefect server start
   ```
8. Register blocks and deployments using:
   ```bash
    make prefect_setup
   ```
9. Set prefect api url:
   ```bash
   prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
   ```
10. Run  docker Deployment `infra-docker-storage-docker` using prefect ui or:
      ```bash
      prefect deployment run parent-etl-flow/infra-docker-storage-docker
      ```
11. To run other deployment install all dependencies using: `make env_setup` (Tested on Mac, optional)

### Setup Terraform
<details>
   <summary> Show instructions </summary>

1. [Install terraform on your pc](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli)
2. Clone this (if not already): 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rkscodes/incident_intelligence.git
   cd incident_intelligence/terraform
   ```
3. Initialise terraform with : `terraform init`
4. Refer [Setup GCP](#setup-gcp) and follow all steps.
5. Update `project`  var in `variables.tf` with GCP project id.
6. Authenticate the service first:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={{path_to_application_credential}}
   gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file ${GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS}
   ```
7. Generate a SSH key using:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/<name> -C <username> -b 2048
   ```
8. Update `gce_ssh_user, gce_ssh_pub_key_file` variable in `variables.tf` with generated public key username and file path. 
9. Optionally could modify `region, zone, data_lake_bucket` if required
10. Please make sure you have exported:  
      ```bash
      export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={{path_to_application_credential}}
      ```
11. `terraform validate`
12. `terraform plan`
13. `terraform apply`
14. Your infra should be up and running. 
15. One caveat if you decide to use `terraform destroy` VPC network are sometimes not destroyed so destroy `my-network` manually in google cloud ui.
